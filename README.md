# Project 2
## Welcome to my book Review Website Continuation.
#### ENGO 651

#### Description
This Book Review project is developed for the ENGO651 course at the University of Calgary, designed to explore and utilize communication techniques between Flask, SQL, HTML, Python, and JSON for web design applications. The core objective of this assignment was to create a book review website leveraging a provided database (books.csv) and integrating the Google API to enrich the platform with additional book rating content.

Book Details Page: /book - This page includes book details and ratings, incorporating data from the Google API where available. Additionally, the site offers API access at /api/, presenting book data in JSON format for broader applicability.

Repository Structure
The GitHub repository includes:

* application.py: The main Python file powering the Flask application.
* templates/: A collection of HTML templates for each webpage, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface.
* import.py: A Python script designed for importing the books.csv data file into the database.
* books.csv: The data file containing information on books, serving as the foundational database for the website.
* README

This project serves not only as an academic exercise but also as a practical implementation of web development techniques, showcasing the integration of Flask with SQL, HTML, Python, and JSON to create a functional and informative book review platform.
